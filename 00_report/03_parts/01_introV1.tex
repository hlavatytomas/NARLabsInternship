\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The present work arose as the part of the authors student internship in Taiwan National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs). The report was written in National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC). 

The main contribution of the present work lies in the  development of the OpenFOAM computational framework compatible with the NCHC computational servers. As the tutorial case of the interest, the spreading of a pollution in an inhabited area has been chosen. 

The work is structured as follows, 
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item mathematical model is described together with the used assumptions (Section~\ref{sec:mathMod}), 
    \item computational framework (environment) is introduced with the usage guideline (Section~\ref{sec:env}), and
    \item the results are briefly discussed (Section~\ref{sec:exp}).
\end{inparaenum}
