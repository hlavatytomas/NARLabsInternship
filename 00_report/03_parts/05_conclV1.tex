\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

The main contribution of the present work lies in the development of the computational framework enabling to run OpenFOAM simulations on NCHC servers. In particular, we describe the preparation of the Singularity container, OpenFOAM installation, and custom OpenFOAM application compilation within. Furthermore, example of the Slurm control script compatible with Taiwania~3 is presented. The developed framework is tested on the tutorial case of the flow and air pollution spreading inside the inhabited area. All the used source codes and this report are available at~\texttt{https://github.com/hlavatytomas/NARLabsInternship}.
